# 📐 Computational Linear Algebra

Efficient algebraic algorithms & numerical methods in Python.

## 📋 Description

This project implements fundamental linear algebra algorithms in two parts:

### Part 1 — Permutation Order
Computing the order of a permutation using two approaches:
- **Direct computation** via successive powers until identity
- **Cycle decomposition** via LCM of cycle lengths

### Part 2 — Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization
Implementation of the Gram-Schmidt procedure for orthogonalizing vectors in ℝⁿ.
